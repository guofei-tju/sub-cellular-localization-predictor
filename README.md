# Identification of protein subcellular localization via integrating evolutionary and physicochemical information into Chou's general PseAAC

About
We propose a multi-kernel SVM to predict subcellular localization of both multi-location and single-location proteins. We built a custome kernel for the SVM classifier, test the method on two human datasets and use three indicators to evaluate the results.

Input: Features extracted from protein
